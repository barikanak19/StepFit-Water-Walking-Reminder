## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | React 18+ (functional components + hooks) |
| Build Tool | Vite 5 |
| Styling | Inline CSS-in-JS + global `<style>` keyframes |
| Fonts | Google Fonts — Nunito |
| Animations | Pure CSS keyframes (`fadeSlide`, `float`, `orbit`, `pulse`, `slideUp`) |
| State | `useState`, `useEffect` — no external state library |
| Backend | None — 100% client-side |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration & Defaults

All defaults live in `HealthTracker.jsx` and can be changed before building:

```js
// Default settings object (App component)
const DEFAULT_SETTINGS = {
  dailyGoal:   2000,   // ml
  glassSize:   250,    // ml per drink
  remindersOn: true,
};
```

To add more goal or glass-size options, extend the arrays inside `SettingsModal`:

```js
const goalOptions  = [1500, 2000, 2500, 3000];   // add e.g. 3500
const glassOptions = [150, 200, 250, 300, 350];   // add e.g. 400
```

## 🎨 Design Tokens

The app uses a consistent palette defined inline. Key colours:

| Role | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary gradient | `#1d4ed8` → `#4338ca` → `#6d28d9` |
| Page background | `#e0f2fe` → `#ede9fe` → `#f0fdf4` |
| Morning card | `#fef3c7` → `#fbbf24` |
| Night card | `#1e1b4b` → `#4c1d95` |
| Motivation card | `#ecfdf5` → `#a7f3d0` |
| Footer | `#0f172a` → `#1e293b` |

---

## 📐 Responsive Behaviour

- **Mobile** (`≤ 420px`) — fills the full screen width, native app feel
- **Tablet / Desktop** — content is capped at `420px` and horizontally centred via `body { display:flex; justify-content:center }`, with a soft indigo glow shadow making it look like a phone frame

No media queries are required; the single `max-width` rule handles everything.
